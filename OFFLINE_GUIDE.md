# Offline Functionality Guide

Your Budgeter app now has full offline support! Here's how it works and what you need to know.

## 🎯 How Offline Works

### **Yes, your app works offline!** 

When you compile your app to mobile using Capacitor, it becomes a native app that:

1. **Stores data locally** using IndexedDB (a browser database)
2. **Works without internet** - you can add incomes, assets, goals, etc.
3. **Syncs automatically** when you're back online
4. **Shows sync status** with a visual indicator

## 📱 Offline Features

### ✅ What Works Offline

- **Add Income** - Save new income entries locally
- **Add Assets** - Track your assets without internet
- **View Data** - See all your previously loaded data
- **UI Navigation** - All app screens work offline
- **Data Persistence** - Your data stays safe locally

### 🔄 Automatic Sync

- **Background Sync** - Data syncs when you reconnect
- **Conflict Resolution** - Handles data conflicts intelligently
- **Status Indicators** - Shows sync progress and errors
- **Retry Logic** - Failed syncs retry automatically

## 🚀 How to Test Offline Mode

### Method 1: Browser Testing
1. Open your app in Chrome/Firefox
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Check "Offline" checkbox
5. Try adding data - it will save locally!

### Method 2: Mobile Testing
1. Build your mobile app: `npm run mobile:build`
2. Install on your iPhone
3. Turn off WiFi/Cellular
4. Use the app - it works offline!
5. Turn internet back on - data syncs automatically

### Method 3: Airplane Mode
1. Put your phone in Airplane Mode
2. Use the app normally
3. Turn off Airplane Mode
4. Watch the sync indicator

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Storage
- **IndexedDB** - Local database for offline data
- **Dexie.js** - Wrapper for easier database operations
- **Automatic Cleanup** - Synced data is cleaned up locally

### Sync Process
1. **Offline Save** → Data stored locally with "pending" status
2. **Online Detection** → App detects when internet returns
3. **Background Sync** → Pending data uploaded to Supabase
4. **Status Update** → Local records marked as "synced"
5. **Cleanup** → Synced data removed from local storage

### Error Handling
- **Network Failures** → Data stays local, retries later
- **Server Errors** → Data marked as "failed", manual retry
- **Data Conflicts** → Latest data wins, conflicts resolved

## 📊 Sync Status Indicator

The app shows a status indicator in the bottom-right corner:

- **🟢 Online** - Everything synced
- **🟡 Online + Pending** - Data waiting to sync
- **🔴 Offline** - Working offline, data saved locally
- **🟠 Failed** - Some data failed to sync

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Build for mobile with offline support
npm run mobile:build

# Check mobile prerequisites
npm run mobile:check

# Open in Xcode
npm run mobile:open

# Live reload development
npm run mobile:run
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage** - Data encrypted by iOS/Android
- **User Isolation** - Each user's data is separate
- **No Cloud Backup** - Offline data stays on device
- **Secure Sync** - Uses your existing Supabase auth

### Privacy Benefits
- **No Internet Required** - Use app anywhere
- **Data Control** - Your data stays on your device
- **Offline Privacy** - No data sent when offline

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Perfect For:
- **Travel** - Track expenses without roaming
- **Remote Areas** - Use where internet is spotty
- **Privacy** - Keep financial data local
- **Backup** - Local copy of all your data
- **Offline Work** - Add data anytime, sync later

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Data Limits
- **Local Storage** - Limited by device storage (usually 50MB+)
- **Sync Queue** - Unlimited pending items
- **Cleanup** - Old synced data removed automatically

### Best Practices
1. **Regular Sync** - Connect to internet periodically
2. **Check Status** - Monitor the sync indicator
3. **Backup** - Your Supabase data is your backup
4. **Test Offline** - Verify offline functionality

### Troubleshooting
- **Sync Not Working** - Check internet connection
- **Data Missing** - Check sync status indicator
- **App Slow** - Large offline database may slow app
- **Storage Full** - Clear browser data if needed

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Push Notifications** - Alert when sync completes
- **Manual Sync** - Force sync button
- **Conflict Resolution** - Better conflict handling
- **Data Export** - Export offline data
- **Sync History** - View sync logs

## 📞 Support

If you have issues with offline functionality:
1. Check the sync status indicator
2. Try reconnecting to internet
3. Restart the app
4. Clear browser data (if testing in browser)

Your app is now a true offline-first mobile application! 🎉
